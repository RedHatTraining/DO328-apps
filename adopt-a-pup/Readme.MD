# Adopt a Pup Application

## Deploying the application in Red&nbsp;Hat OpenShift 
Create a project.
```
oc new-project adopt-a-pup
```

Deploy the MongoDB container
```
sh scripts/deploy-mongo.sh
```

Populate the MongoDB database
```
sh scripts/populate-mongo.sh
```

Deploy the required services.
```
oc apply -f kubefiles/adoption-service.yaml
oc apply -f kubefiles/animal-service.yaml
oc apply -f kubefiles/notification-service.yaml 
oc apply -f kubefiles/shelter-service.yaml
oc apply -f kubefiles/frontend-service.yaml
```
-----
The `oc` commands in this script can be run to create the adopt-a-pup application. This will deploy the backend services including adoption, shelter, animal, and notification services. It will also build a fake smtp service which can be used to test email delivery.

# Deploy the microservices. Start with a clean project.
## Create new project
`oc new-project adopt-a-pup`

## Start builds - Image streams will be created
We build the apps using s2i. There is NO extra configuration or extra files needed for this. Openshift will build these images using a Maven builder and deploy them to its internal registry. It will then create an ImageStream object for each of them. 
```
oc new-build  openshift/java:latest~https://github.com/jonahkh/DO328-apps --context-dir=adopt-a-pup/animal-service --name=animal-service -n adopt-a-pup
oc new-build  openshift/java:latest~https://github.com/jonahkh/DO328-apps --context-dir=adopt-a-pup/adoption-service --name=adoption-service -n adopt-a-pup
oc new-build  openshift/java:latest~https://github.com/jonahkh/DO328-apps --context-dir=adopt-a-pup/shelter-service --name=shelter-service -n adopt-a-pup
oc new-build  openshift/java:latest~https://github.com/jonahkh/DO328-apps --context-dir=adopt-a-pup/notification-service --name=notification-service -n adopt-a-pup
```
Run these commands after the builds have completed ensuring that the image streams have been created

```
oc new-app --template=openshift/mongodb-persistent --name=mongodb -e MONGODB_USER=developer -e MONGODB_PASSWORD=developer -e MONGODB_DATABASE=adopt-a-pup -n adopt-a-pup
oc new-app --name=notification-service adopt-a-pup/notification-service -n adopt-a-pup
oc new-app --name=adoption-service adopt-a-pup/adoption-service -n adopt-a-pup
oc new-app --name=animal-service adopt-a-pup/animal-service -n adopt-a-pup
oc new-app --name=shelter-service adopt-a-pup/shelter-service -n adopt-a-pup
```

# Deploy "fake" smtp server
Run the following commands to allow the maildev pod to listen on port 25 and Openshift requires escalated permissions to run on a port lower than 1024
```
oc create serviceaccount maildev
oc patch dc/email-service --patch '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"serviceAccountName": "maildev"}}}}'
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z maildev
```
MailDev is an open source email server testing application that allows you to spin up a fake email server for testing.
Any email sent from the notification service to this pod will be visible in the UI described later.
 
`quay.io/redhattraining/maildev:latest` is a custom-built public image from https://github.com/maildev/maildev.
 
The original image can be found on docker hub at `https://hub.docker.com/r/maildev/maildev`.

`oc new-app --name=email-service quay.io/redhattraining/maildev:latest`

# Load data into Mongo
There is dummy data in the adopt-a-pup/mongo-data directory that can be imported into the newly created mongo instance
You must have mongodb-org installed (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-red-hat/)

```
oc port-forward <mongo-pod-name> 27017:27017
mongoimport --db=adopt-a-pup --collection=animals --username=developer --password=developer adopt-a-pup/mongo-data/animals.mongo
mongoimport --db=adopt-a-pup --collection=shelters --username=developer --password=developer adopt-a-pup/mongo-data/shelters.mongo
```
# Swagger
If you want to test any of the services running on OpenShift locally you must run `oc expose svc <service-name>` or port-forward the pod
Then run `oc get routes` and use the route(s) in the response below

`<ocp-host>/swagger-ui.html` for all of them

# There are now two shelters each with 2 animals created.

Once all the data has been loaded and the application is running, you can test by applying for adoption with the following request:

`curl -X POST "http://{{adoption-service-host}}/adoption/applyForAdoption" -H "accept: */*" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ \"animalId\": \"e22d494c-c2be-4d32-bceb-ec675fd5540a\", \"email\": \"harvey@gmail.com\", \"kidsUnder16\": false, \"occupation\": \"Engineer\", \"ownOtherAnimals\": true, \"residency\": \"HOUSE\", \"squareFootageOfHome\": 2000, \"username\": \"Dog-Dad\"}"`

To test that the email notification was delivered successfully (assuming the response was a 200) do the following:
`oc port-forward <email-service-pod-name> <arbitrary-port>:80`

Then, open a browser and go to `http://localhost:<arbitrary-port> and you should see your email`
